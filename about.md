My name is Anten Skrabec (as I state above) and I am a programmer, a sort of tech support "specialist", and general, all-around computer enthusiast. I live in the Rocky Mountain West of the United States. I hope to study Computer Science in university though I am not sure exactly where I want to go for sure yet.
